# Let’s talk about your WHY

Many people focus on WHAT they do, some on HOW to accomplish tasks, but few consider the WHY. In an enlightening LinkedIn article about Education in the age of AI: 6 crucial shifts, Fred Swaniker emphasizes that in this technology-driven era, understanding the 'Why’ will be more important than the 'What’. 

Before embarking on your entrepreneurial journey, it’s essential to pause and deeply consider your WHY.

Why did you choose to become an entrepreneur? What are those driving factors that have you doing hard things? What is your WHY? To help you think through and answer these paramount questions, watch this powerful and classic TedTalk by Simon Sinek, who speaks to the power of knowing your WHY. It will soon help you realize that people don’t buy what you create or do; they buy WHY you do it.

Building a company for its own sake might not be enough for you unless coupled with a meaningful mission that enables you to contribute meaningfully to the global narrative.
