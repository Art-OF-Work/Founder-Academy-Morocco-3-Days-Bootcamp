# ⭐ How to Submit Deliverable 2 - Landing Page (MVP)

Yay!!! You have gotten to the fun part! It’s time to create your MVP.

We recommend starting with a landing page if you haven’t already. This landing page will be your MVP submission. Your landing page should:

- Clearly convey your product’s main value proposition.

- Engage visitors and prompt them to take action, such as signing up for more information or trying a demo.

Follow the steps below to create your landing page:

Step 1: Make a copy of the [Product Landing Page Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PzAdEzX_VJwkzaYzPzGQcWAqus5_iszsBCD5s_FaSzQ/copy) and choose one of the free tools provided in the template to build your landing page.

Step 2: Ensure your landing page is live and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Double-check that everything works smoothly.

Step 3: Submit the link to your live landing page using the submission form here: https://shorturl.at/nvjI4

That’s it! Once your landing page is live, you’ll be one step closer to launching your product. 

Good luck with your landing page creation!
