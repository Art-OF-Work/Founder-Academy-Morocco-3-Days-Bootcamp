# MVP: Minimum Viable Product

AI For Interactive Prototyping

Leveraging AI can make the design process much easier by helping you quickly refine concepts without needing extensive coding or design skills. AI-powered tools allow you to create and adjust prototypes rapidly, speeding up development and giving you the freedom to explore more ideas and solutions.

Depending on the tool you choose, the functionality may vary, but many AI-driven UI makers can transform simple sketches or wireframes into working prototypes that simulate the final product. Some tools even let you use prompts to generate the basic elements of your prototype, which you can then customize to fit your vision. This allows founders to experiment and innovate with fewer barriers.

The Uizard AI tool is the first tool that you will explore. Watch the video below to see how it works. As you watch, ensure that you can answer the following questions:

1. What input is required to start creating a prototype with Uizard?

2. How many prototype screens can Uizard create?
