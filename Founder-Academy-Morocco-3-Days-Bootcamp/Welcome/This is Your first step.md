# This is Your first step

The Founder Academy is the first step with ALX Ventures, which aims to help entrepreneurs turn their ideas into successful businesses. This course is designed to provide valuable insights to both new and experienced entrepreneurs to help them elevate their startup game. 

Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn from a number of successful entrepreneurs who have launched their businesses in Africa and beyond. They have proven their ability to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. And now, it’s your turn. This course is divided into three themes: Think, Build, and Launch. 

You will gain access to valuable insights, real-life stories, tips, and templates that will help you build a successful startup. To graduate from this course and move on to the next stage, you will be required to complete a deliverable at the end of each day. 

We have also created videos that provide a more detailed profile of each of the featured founders so you can learn more about their stories. You can find these videos in the bonus section at the end of the course.

The key deliverables you will need to submit at the end of each sprint are:

- Day 1: Lean Canvas

- Day 2: Minimum viable product (MVP)

- Day 3: Pitch Deck

We’ll share more specific guidelines on each of these deliverables later in this course.
Remember - becoming a startup founder can be one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences you’ll pursue in your life, but it can also be one of the most difficult tasks you’ll ever undertake.

We’re glad you’ve taken the first step towards enrolling in the Founder Academy, and we’ll be here with you along the way. 

Good luck!
